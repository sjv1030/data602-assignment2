Data602 Assignment #2

My python code works just fine locally. However, I couldn't figure out how to get it to work in Docker because of MongoDB. 
I couldn't find a helpful resource on the class's Blackboard page in terms of installing MongoDB in a Docker container.

I also tried the Mlab.com route, but couldn't figure out how to connect to my cloud database via PyMongo in my Python code.
I think a video showing how to do this would be extremely valuable for future assignments.

As a result, I'm submitting the source files for this assignment but not docker image.
